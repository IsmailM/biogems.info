%h1 Create a Biogem!

%p
  Biogem provides a set of tools for those Bioinformaticans who
  want to start coding an application, or a library for
  using/extending BioRuby's core library and sharing the code as a
  gem through rubygems.org. Biogems are automatically listed at
  biogems.info when the gem is pushed to rubygems.org, using the
  biogem tool, and the name of the gem starts with bio- (bio dash),
  e.g. bio-fasta or bio-gff3.
%p
  Biogem aims to encourage open source software development, and provide 
  tools to support

  programming. In our interpretation:
  %ul
    %li Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch
    %li Release source code early and often
    %li With enough users, almost every problem is quickly known, and a fix obvious
    %li Many heads are inevitably better than one
    %li Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse)
