# BioRuby and distributed development

With the distributed development of biogems, as listed on http://biogems.info/,
the BioRuby community is one of the most active Open Bioinformatics Foundation
communities in terms of number of projects, git commits and library downloads.

In this talk we will quantify and visualize what it means to allow contributing
independent small modules and tools to the bioinformatics community. Not only
has the decision to distribute development led to a larger group of regular
contributors, less strain on the core maintainers, but also a number of useful
command line tools have been introduced, such as bioruby-table,
bioruby-samtools, bioruby-ngs and bioruby-vcf. The code generators that we use
allow for rapid creation of new software modules with a command line interface,
a testing frame work and support for the Travis testing service. 

In addition we will discuss how the BioRuby community is making great strides
in leveraging web technologies for data analysis with web services and
towards linked data. 

We would like to track other Bio* projects in http://biogems.info/ and make it
a more comprehensive resource for OBF. The BOSC meeting will allow us to fine
tune such ideas.
